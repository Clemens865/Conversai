# Name Memory Issue - Root Cause Found

## Problem
The AI is making up random names (James, Daniel) instead of remembering "Clemens".

## Root Cause
**The database is completely empty** - there are:
- 0 messages in the database
- 0 embeddings generated
- 0 messages containing "Clemens"

## Why This Happens
1. **Authentication Issue**: The script shows no authenticated user, which suggests messages might not be saving due to auth problems
2. **Empty Database**: Either the database was cleared or messages were never saved

## Solution Steps
1. **Ensure you're logged in** in the browser when using ConversAI
2. **Start a fresh conversation** and say "My name is Clemens"
3. **Verify messages are being saved** by checking the network tab in browser DevTools
4. **Start a new conversation** and ask "Do you know my name?"

## Technical Details
- Vector search functions: ✅ Working
- Embedding infrastructure: ✅ Set up correctly
- Context retrieval: ✅ Implemented properly
- Database content: ❌ Empty

## Next Actions
1. Test the authentication flow in the app
2. Verify messages are being saved to the database
3. Check for any errors in the browser console during conversations
