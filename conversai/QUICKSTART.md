# ConversAI Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Your Conversational AI is Ready!

The application is now running at: http://localhost:3002

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

1. **Voice Processing Pipeline**
   - ✅ Deepgram STT (Speech-to-Text) integration
   - ✅ OpenAI GPT-4 for conversation AI
   - ✅ ElevenLabs TTS (Text-to-Speech) integration
   - ✅ Real-time streaming voice pipeline

2. **Conversation Management**
   - ✅ Supabase database integration
   - ✅ Conversation persistence
   - ✅ Message history tracking
   - ✅ Basic memory search

3. **User Interface**
   - ✅ Authentication system
   - ✅ Voice recording interface
   - ✅ Real-time conversation display
   - ✅ Status indicators

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Sign Up/Sign In**
   - Create an account or sign in with your email
   - The system will create a new conversation session

2. **Start Talking**
   - Click the blue microphone button to start recording
   - Speak naturally - the AI will transcribe your speech in real-time
   - Click the red stop button when done
   - The AI will process your input and respond with voice

3. **Features**
   - Real-time speech transcription
   - Natural AI responses
   - Conversation history saved to database
   - Voice synthesis for AI responses

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Keys**: Make sure your `.env.local` file has valid API keys:
   - Deepgram API key for speech recognition
   - OpenAI API key for AI responses
   - ElevenLabs API key for voice synthesis

2. **Browser Permissions**: Allow microphone access when prompted

3. **Known Limitations (MVP)**
   - Basic keyword search (semantic search coming in Phase 2)
   - Fixed context window of 10 messages
   - Simple memory retrieval
   - No voice customization yet

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you see errors:

1. **"Missing API keys"**: Check your `.env.local` file
2. **Microphone errors**: Check browser permissions
3. **No voice output**: Check browser audio settings
4. **Database errors**: Ensure Supabase schema is applied

## 🔜 Next Steps (Phase 2)

- Vector embeddings for semantic memory search
- Conversation summarization
- Voice preferences and customization
- Performance optimizations for <200ms latency
- Advanced context management

## 📝 Testing Conversations

Try these sample conversations:

1. **Basic Chat**
   - "Hello, how are you?"
   - "What's the weather like?"
   - "Tell me a joke"

2. **Memory Test**
   - "My name is [Your Name]"
   - "What's my name?" (in a later conversation)

3. **Context Test**
   - Have a conversation about a topic
   - Reference it later: "What did we talk about earlier?"
