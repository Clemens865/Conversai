# ConversAI Multi-Tier Memory Architecture

## Overview

ConversAI implements a sophisticated multi-tier memory system designed for ultra-low latency responses while maintaining access to virtually unlimited long-term knowledge. The system uses predictive loading, prompt trees, and multiple specialized agents.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Memory Tiers

#### Short-Term Memory (STM)
- **Purpose**: Ultra-fast conversational context (< 50ms access)
- **Technology**: In-memory cache + Small Language Model (SLM)
- **Capacity**: Last 10-20 exchanges + predicted context
- **Features**:
  - Real-time semantic understanding
  - Context compression using SLM
  - Predictive pre-loading
  - WebSocket updates

#### Long-Term Memory (LTM)
- **Purpose**: Persistent knowledge storage
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL + pgvector embeddings
- **Capacity**: Unlimited (cloud storage)
- **Features**:
  - Vector similarity search
  - Semantic clustering
  - Temporal indexing
  - Cross-conversation learning

#### Working Memory (WM)
- **Purpose**: Active conversation buffer
- **Technology**: Redis/In-memory
- **Capacity**: Current session + predictions
- **Features**:
  - Prompt tree branches
  - Pre-fetched contexts
  - Web search results
  - Active hypotheses

### 2. Agent System

#### Memory Orchestrator Agent
- Coordinates all memory operations
- Decides what to load/unload
- Manages memory pressure
- Tracks access patterns

#### Semantic Search Agent
- Continuously searches LTM
- Identifies relevant memories
- Creates embedding queries
- Ranks results by relevance

#### Prompt Tree Agent
- Predicts conversation directions
- Generates possible branches
- Pre-loads relevant contexts
- Learns from conversation flow

#### Web Research Agent
- Searches for real-time information
- Updates knowledge base
- Fact-checks responses
- Enriches context

### 3. Prompt Tree System

```
Current Context: "Tell me about quantum computing"
                            |
        +-------------------+-------------------+
        |                   |                   |
   [Technical]         [Practical]         [Historical]
        |                   |                   |
   +----+----+         +----+----+         +----+----+
   |         |         |         |         |         |
[Theory] [Math]    [Apps]   [Future]   [Origins] [People]
```

Each branch pre-loads:
- Relevant memories
- Key concepts
- Related conversations
- Web resources

### 4. Learning System

#### Conversation Patterns
- Tracks successful prompt trees
- Identifies common trajectories
- Learns user preferences
- Optimizes predictions

#### Feedback Loops
- Response quality metrics
- User engagement signals
- Conversation coherence
- Memory hit rates

## Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Hierarchical Memory (Default)
- Primary: STM for immediate context
- Secondary: WM for session data
- Tertiary: LTM for deep knowledge
- Predictive loading based on prompt trees

### Strategy 2: Flat Memory with Smart Caching
- All memories in single tier
- Intelligent caching layer
- LRU + semantic relevance
- Dynamic index optimization

### Strategy 3: Agent-First Architecture
- Each agent maintains own memory
- Federated search across agents
- Consensus-based responses
- Specialized knowledge domains

### Strategy 4: Predictive Pipeline
- Continuous background processing
- Multi-step ahead prediction
- Speculative execution
- Branch pruning based on conversation

## Memory Flow Example

```
User: "What's the weather like?"
         |
         v
[STM Check] --> Has location? Has preferences?
         |
         v
[Prompt Tree] --> Weather details? Travel plans? Activity suggestions?
         |
         v
[Pre-load] --> Current weather, forecast, historical patterns
         |
         v
[Web Agent] --> Real-time weather API
         |
         v
[Response] --> Integrated answer with predictions ready
```

## Performance Metrics

### Target Latencies
- STM Access: < 10ms

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "I'm planning a trip to Japan"

System Actions:
1. STM: Recent travel discussions, preferences
2. Prompt Tree: 
   - When? (seasons, events)
   - Where? (cities, regions)
   - What? (culture, food, activities)
   - Budget? (accommodation, transport)
3. Pre-load:
   - Japan travel guides
   - User's previous trips
   - Current events in Japan
   - Weather patterns
4. Web Agent:
   - Flight prices
   - Hotel availability
   - Current restrictions
   - Events calendar

User: "I want to see cherry blossoms"

System: (Already has sakura data loaded!)
- Instant response about best viewing times
- Locations pre-loaded
- Historical bloom data ready
- Accommodation suggestions prepared
```
