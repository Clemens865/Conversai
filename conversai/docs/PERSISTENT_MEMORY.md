# Persistent User Memory in ConversAI

## Overview

ConversAI now implements **true persistent memory** that remembers users across all conversations and sessions. When you log in, KITT immediately knows who you are and recalls everything you've shared.

## How It Works

### 1. User Profile System

Each user has a persistent profile that stores:
- **Name** - Your preferred name
- **Location** - Where you live or are from
- **Occupation** - What you do
- **Interests** - Things you enjoy
- **Personal Facts** - Any information you share
- **Conversation Patterns** - How you like to communicate

### 2. Cross-Conversation Memory

When you ask "Do you know my name?" in a NEW conversation:
1. System searches ALL your past conversations
2. Finds where you introduced yourself
3. Retrieves that information instantly
4. Responds with your name

### 3. Automatic Learning

The system automatically learns from conversations:
```
User: "My name is Clemens"
System: [Stores in permanent profile]

--- New Conversation ---

User: "Do you know who I am?"
System: "Yes, you're Clemens! Welcome back."
```

### 4. Visual Feedback

Look for the **green brain indicator** (ðŸ§ ) in the top-right:
- Shows when system knows your name
- Displays number of facts remembered
- Confirms persistent memory is active

## Database Setup

Run this migration to enable persistent profiles:

```sql
-- Add profile_data column
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Create search function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_user_conversations(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_search_term TEXT
) RETURNS TABLE(...) AS $$ ... $$;
```

## Privacy & Security

- All personal data is stored securely in YOUR profile
- Only accessible when YOU are logged in
- Protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
- You can request deletion at any time

## Testing the Feature

1. **First Conversation**:
   - Say: "My name is [Your Name]"
   - Share other info: "I live in [City]", "I work as [Job]"

2. **Reload the Page** or **Start New Conversation**

3. **Test Memory**:
   - Ask: "Do you know my name?"
   - Ask: "What do you remember about me?"
   - System should recall everything!

## Implementation Details

### UserProfileManager
- Manages persistent user profiles
- Searches across all conversations
- Learns from each interaction
- Updates profile in real-time

### Enhanced Memory Search
- Searches current conversation first
- Falls back to ALL user conversations
- Prioritizes personal information
- Maintains relevance scoring

### System Context
- Includes user profile in EVERY response
- Provides personalized greetings
- References past conversations
- Maintains continuity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Preference Learning**
   - Communication style
   - Topic preferences
   - Response length preferences

2. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Common questions
   - Interaction times
   - Preferred workflows

3. **Relationship Building**
   - Conversation milestones
   - Shared experiences
   - Inside references

## Troubleshooting

If memory isn't working:

1. **Check Profile Indicator** - Green brain should show
2. **Run Migration** - Ensure profile_data column exists
3. **Check Logs** - Look for "Loaded user profile" messages
4. **Clear Cache** - Refresh profile with new conversation

The goal: KITT should feel like a true personal assistant that knows you across time, not just within a single chat session.
