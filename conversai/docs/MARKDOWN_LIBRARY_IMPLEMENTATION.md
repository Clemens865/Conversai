# Markdown Library Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a third approach for ConversAI that uses markdown files stored in localStorage as a knowledge base, with preparation for OpenAI Realtime API integration.

## What We Built

### 1. **Markdown Library Mode** (`/src/lib/modes/markdown-library/`)
- New conversation mode that loads context from structured markdown files
- Uses localStorage for browser-based storage (no server required)
- Prepared for OpenAI Realtime API WebSocket connection
- Features real-time voice processing and context-aware responses

### 2. **Markdown Library Service** (`/src/lib/services/memory/markdownLibraryClient.ts`)
- Client-side service for managing markdown files
- Automatic file organization by categories (personal, context, knowledge)
- Smart context loading based on conversation relevance
- Biography parsing and import functionality

### 3. **OpenAI Realtime API Service** (`/src/lib/services/ai/openai-realtime.ts`)
- WebSocket-based connection to OpenAI's Realtime API
- Handles bidirectional audio streaming
- Server-side Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- PCM16 audio format conversion

### 4. **Biography Import Tool** (`/scripts/import-biography-markdown.html`)
- Standalone HTML tool for importing biography data
- Parses text into structured markdown sections
- Saves to browser localStorage
- Drag-and-drop file support

## Architecture

```
User Biography â†’ Import Tool â†’ Markdown Files (localStorage) â†’ Markdown Library Mode â†’ OpenAI Realtime API
```

### File Structure Created:
```
/memory-library/ (in localStorage)
â”œâ”€â”€ personal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ identity         # Name, age, location, occupation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ background       # Education, career history
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ preferences      # Likes, dislikes, hobbies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ relationships    # Family, friends, pets
â”œâ”€â”€ context/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ current-projects # Active work/hobbies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ goals           # Short/long term goals
â””â”€â”€ knowledge/
    â””â”€â”€ expertise       # Professional knowledge
```

## Key Advantages

1. **Full Context Preservation**: No information loss from extraction
2. **Simple Management**: Edit markdown files directly
3. **Privacy-First**: All data stored locally in browser
4. **Low Latency**: OpenAI Realtime API provides ~500ms response time
5. **Natural Understanding**: LLM sees complete narrative context

## How to Use

### 1. Import Your Biography
```bash
# Open the import tool in your browser
open /Users/clemenshoenig/Documents/My-Coding-Programs/Conversational-AI/conversai/scripts/import-biography-markdown.html

# Or serve it locally
cd conversai && python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000/scripts/import-biography-markdown.html
```

### 2. Access in ConversAI
1. Start the development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3000
3. Select "Markdown Library (Beta)" mode
4. Start conversing - the AI will have access to all your markdown files

## Technical Details

### Context Loading Strategy
- **Full Context**: Loads all files up to 100K characters
- **Relevant Context**: Scores files by keyword matching
- **Core Files**: Always includes identity and background
- **Priority Sorting**: Uses metadata priority field

### OpenAI Realtime API Configuration
```javascript
{
  model: 'gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01',
  modalities: ['text', 'audio'],
  voice: 'alloy',
  input_audio_format: 'pcm16',
  output_audio_format: 'pcm16',
  turn_detection: {
    type: 'server_vad',
    threshold: 0.5,
    silence_duration_ms: 200
  }
}
```

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Markdown library architecture and service
- Biography import tool with parsing
- localStorage integration
- Mode registration and UI integration
- Basic OpenAI Realtime API structure

### ðŸš§ Pending
- Complete WebSocket audio streaming implementation
- Add audio playback for responses
- Handle connection errors and reconnection
- Add markdown file editor UI
- Test with actual OpenAI Realtime API key

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Import Tool**: Import your biography and verify localStorage
2. **Complete Audio Pipeline**: Finish WebSocket audio handling
3. **Add Error Handling**: Robust connection management
4. **Create Editor UI**: In-app markdown editing
5. **Performance Testing**: Measure latency and optimize

## Cost Considerations

OpenAI Realtime API pricing:
- Audio input: $0.06/minute
- Audio output: $0.24/minute
- More expensive than Whisper + TTS but provides better experience

## Migration Path

The markdown library approach can coexist with existing modes:
- Memory Mode (Supabase): For cloud-based fact storage
- Claude Local-First: For privacy with Claude API
- Markdown Library: For full-context with OpenAI Realtime

Each mode serves different use cases and privacy requirements.
