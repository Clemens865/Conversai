# Markdown Library Mode - Current Status

## What's Working ✅

1. **Mode Structure**
   - Mode appears in UI with proper metadata
   - Voice/AI/Storage fields display correctly
   - Mode can be selected and initialized

2. **Audio Capture**
   - Microphone access works
   - Audio chunks are being recorded (you see the logs)
   - Audio buffer is created successfully

3. **Markdown Library**
   - localStorage integration works
   - Biography can be imported
   - Context loading is implemented

## What's Missing ❌

1. **OpenAI Realtime API Connection**
   - WebSocket authentication needs proper implementation
   - The API requires authentication that browsers can't provide via headers
   - Need to use the correct authentication method for browser environments

2. **Audio Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   Current: Audio Captured → Logged → Nothing
   Needed:  Audio Captured → WebSocket → OpenAI → Response → TTS → Playback
   ```

3. **Response Handling**
   - Message parsing from WebSocket
   - Audio streaming back to user
   - Error handling for API limits

## The Issue

When you click record, you see:
```
Audio chunk received: 1128
Audio chunk received: 1932
```

This means audio capture is working, but the chunks aren't being sent anywhere because:
1. The WebSocket connection to OpenAI isn't established
2. The authentication method needs adjustment for browser use
3. The audio processing pipeline is incomplete

## Solutions

### Option 1: Complete the Realtime API Implementation
This requires:
- Proper browser-compatible authentication
- WebSocket message handling
- Audio streaming implementation
- Error handling

### Option 2: Use Standard OpenAI API (Easier)
Instead of Realtime API, use:
- Web Speech API for STT (like Claude mode)
- Regular OpenAI API for responses
- Web Speech API for TTS
- This would work immediately with minor changes

### Option 3: Server-Side Proxy
- Create an API endpoint that handles WebSocket connection
- Browser connects to your server, server connects to OpenAI
- This bypasses browser WebSocket limitations

## Next Steps

1. **Quick Fix**: Switch to Web Speech API + Standard OpenAI API
2. **Full Implementation**: Complete the Realtime API with proper auth
3. **Import Biography**: Use the import tool to load your biography
4. **Test**: Once working, the AI will have full context from your markdown

## Testing

To test what IS working:
1. Import your biography: 
   ```
   open conversai/scripts/import-biography-direct-markdown.html
   ```
2. Check localStorage in browser DevTools
3. Try text input (if available) to see context loading

The audio recording works - it's just not connected to the AI yet!
