# Improved Memory Approach - Hybrid Solution

## What We Found

Our diagnostic revealed that semantic similarity between:
- "My name is Clemens" and "Do you know my name?" = **only 35.05%**
- Best case scenario still only reached **51.46%**
- Our threshold of 0.6 (60%) was filtering out ALL name-related matches

## The New Hybrid Approach

### 1. **Structured User Profile Storage**
- Created `user_profiles` table for explicit facts
- Automatically extracts and stores names when users introduce themselves
- Pattern matching for: "My name is X", "I am X", "Call me X", etc.

### 2. **Dual Retrieval Strategy**
When user asks about their name:
1. **First**: Check structured user profile (instant, 100% accurate)
2. **Fallback**: Use semantic search with lowered threshold (0.4)

### 3. **Semantic Search Improvements**
- Lowered similarity threshold from 0.6 to 0.4
- Better query transformation for name queries
- Still useful for general context and non-structured information

## Implementation Details

### New Files:
- `/src/lib/services/memory/userProfileService.ts` - Handles structured data
- `/supabase/migrations/create_user_profiles_table.sql` - Database schema

### Updated Files:
- `contextManager.ts` - Now checks user profile first, extracts names automatically
- Similarity threshold lowered to 0.4

## Testing the Fix

1. **Apply the migration** in Supabase:
   ```sql
   -- Run: /supabase/migrations/create_user_profiles_table.sql
   ```

2. **Refresh your browser** to get the new code

3. **Test flow**:
   - Say: "My name is Clemens"
   - The system will automatically extract and store this
   - Ask: "Do you know my name?"
   - Should respond with your name from the profile!

## Why This Works Better

1. **100% Accuracy** for critical facts like names
2. **No dependency** on semantic similarity for exact information
3. **Immediate retrieval** - no similarity calculations needed
4. **Fallback to semantic search** for general context
5. **Automatic extraction** - users don't need to do anything special

## Future Improvements

1. **Conversation Chunking**: Group 3-5 messages for richer embeddings
2. **Entity Types**: Extend to preferences, locations, relationships
3. **Metadata Embeddings**: Include intent and context in embeddings
4. **Multi-Stage Retrieval**: Combine multiple search strategies
