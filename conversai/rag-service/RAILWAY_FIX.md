# üö® Railway Service Running but Not Accessible

## Current Status
‚úÖ Service is running and connected to database
‚úÖ Listening on port 8080
‚ùå Railway returning 502 error
‚ùå CORS headers not being sent

## The Issue
Railway is not properly proxying requests to your service. This is happening because Railway expects the service to bind to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) on the PORT it provides.

## Quick Fix in Railway Dashboard

### Option 1: Check Railway Service Settings
1. Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your service
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Look for "Networking" or "Domains" section
4. Make sure your service has a domain assigned
5. Check if there's a "Generate Domain" button - click it if present

### Option 2: Add PORT Environment Variable
1. Go to Variables tab
2. Check if PORT is set - if it is, remove it
3. Let Railway assign it automatically

### Option 3: Check Service Configuration
1. In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your service
2. Check the "Deploy" tab
3. Look for any errors in the build or deploy logs
4. Ensure the service name matches what we're using in the URL

## Testing
Once fixed, test with:
```bash
curl https://conversai-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "conversai-rag",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "database_configured": true,
  "mode": "full"
}
```

## If Still Not Working
The service might need to be redeployed. In Railway:
1. Go to your service
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. Or trigger a new deployment by pushing a small change
